                OFFF invites the most influential designers from all around the world to give a speech to share their work and expertise. It's a must-go event for designers, students and anyone interested in design. The three days we have spent at OFFF Barcelona 2017 has changed our perspective and taught us invaluable lessons. Read on to see the highlights from the 5 most striking talks given by the speakers this year.


                1. On Storytelling - Imaginary Forces
                Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, "methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve, have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books, these rules have to be brought back to life and applied."

                Front matter, or preliminaries, is the first section of a book, and is usually the smallest section in terms of the number of pages. Each page is counted, but no folio or page number is expressed, or printed, on either display pages or blank pages.

                Michelle Dougherty is the director of the main titles of many popular TV series; Stranger Things, Black Sails and Jessica Jones are only some of the titles she has worked on. As Karin and Michelle explained their works and process, they talked about each project in detail.

                As Karin was explaining her reasoning behind the work she created for the God of War III trailer, she said she realized that there needed to be a story behind the main character. In order to make the audience empathize with the protagonist, Kratos, she decided to tell the story of his past.

                In order to understand his fight, Karin thought it was necessary to understand how he came to be the person he is now. As a result, the trailer for the game tells the story of how Kratos killed her child and wife, suffering from his tormented soul for years until one day he became the God of War.
